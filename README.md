**Release Candidate** is a [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) plugin developed by [smartcode ltd](http://smartcodeltd.co.uk) to make
integrating Maven projects with [Continuous Delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery)
pipelines a little bit easier.

The plugin allows your build server to read the current version of a Maven project and update it automatically
as part of the build process to include any additional metadata,
such as an identifier of the commit that triggered the build, current timestamp, build number, etc.

Release Candidate is designed to work with any popular <abbr title="Continuous Integration">CI</abbr> server,
such as
[Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/),
[TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/)
and others.
